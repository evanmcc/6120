# Evan's 6120 self-directed course blog and materials.

Hi! Welcome to my run through Cornell's cs6120 course materials.  Everything that I am doing should be trackable here, assuming that I can get git submodules to play along.  Once a lesson is done I will push a tag and provide a link below.

## blog

If you prefer a more verbose version, the blog (coming soon, I promise), will be [here](https://6120.evanmcc.com/).
