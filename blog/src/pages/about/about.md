This is a single-serving blog I am keeping to document my self-guided pass through [Cornell's cs6120](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6120), taught by [Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/).  It is being done in early 2025, so may not be reflective of your experience with the course if it happens in some other year.

I'm Evan Vigil-McClanahan, a programmer and programming languages enthusiast.  Please send me an [email](mailto:mcclanahan@gmail.com) if you have any questions or comments.  This material is also online at https://github.com/evanmcc/6120/ if you want to fix something.

This blog uses a hacked up version of the [miniblog theme]() for [Astro](https://astro.build/).
